# SuperMarket-Inventory-Management-System
Supermarket inventory management system using C++ is a software solution that allows a supermarket to manage their inventory efficiently. The system typically includes functionalities such as adding new products, updating product details, removing products, and tracking the quantity of products available in the supermarket's inventory.

In addition, the system can keep track of sales, generate reports on sales trends, and identify products that are low in stock. The software may also feature functionalities for purchasing products from suppliers and updating the stock levels accordingly.

The system is typically designed to improve the supermarket's efficiency and reduce the likelihood of stock shortages or overstocking. It can also help the supermarket to identify which products are popular and which are not, enabling the supermarket to make informed decisions when restocking its inventory.
